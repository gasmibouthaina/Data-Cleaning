# Data-Cleaning
data cleaning techniques

Most of the real-world data, that the data scientist work with, are raw data, meaning that it can contain repeated, missing, and irrelevant entries of information. Hence, if this data is used in any machine learning analysis, it will result in low accuracy or incorrect prediction. For this reason, data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is an important technique that comes prior to any model building.

In this notebook, we will take a look at some of the common data cleaning techniques  may use to prepare their data for analysis.

Objectives: 
Use Log function to transform the data
Handle the duplicates
Handle the missing values
Standardize and normalize the data
Handle the outliers
For this , we will be using the following libraries:

pandas for managing the data.

numpy for mathematical operations.

seaborn for visualizing the data.

matplotlib for visualizing the data.

sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.

scipy for statistical computations.
